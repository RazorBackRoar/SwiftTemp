# Contributing to SwiftTemp

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **SwiftTemp**
([RazorBackRoar/SwiftTemp](https://github.com/RazorBackRoar/SwiftTemp)).

This guide matches the RazorBackRoar organization standard. Project-specific
build details live in [BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md](BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md).

## Code of Conduct

Participation is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By contributing, you agree to uphold it.

## Security

Do **not** file public issues for vulnerabilities. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## How to Contribute

1. Prefer a focused change (one intent per PR).
2. Open a Pull Request against `main`.
3. Keep CI green. Do not force-push to `main`.
4. Use Conventional Commits when writing commit messages
   (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `ci:`).

Agent note: automated agents must not create branches, commit, push, open PRs,
or delete branches unless the user explicitly asks for that Git action. In this
workspace, `razor-autosync` may commit locally; publishing uses
`RAZORCORE_AUTO_PUSH=1`.

## Development Setup

See [BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md](BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md) for prerequisites, build,
packaging, and release steps for this repository.

- Use Swift 6 language mode (see `Package.swift`).
- Engine and business-logic changes need tests in `Tests/SwiftTempTests`.
- Do not add third-party dependencies unless they are strictly necessary.
- Run `swift test` before opening a pull request.

## Pull Requests

- Describe **why** the change is needed.
- Link related issues when applicable.
- Include screenshots for UI changes when helpful.
- Keep diffs minimal — avoid unrelated refactors.
